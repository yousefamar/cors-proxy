# CORS Proxy

The name of this repo is self-explanatory. This was originally just a simple script, but I'm putting it on here so it's easier to deploy, as I'm running it off of fly.io from now on.

## Usage

```
npm install
node start
```

If you want to run it off of fly.io:

```
flyctl deploy
```
